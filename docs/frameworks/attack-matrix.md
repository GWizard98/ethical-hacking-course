# ATT&CK Coverage Matrix (Concise)

This matrix lists representative ATT&CK techniques touched at a conceptual level by module.

- 07 Network Security: TA0005 (Defense Evasion, hardening), TA0009 (Collection, logs)
- 11 Defensive Basics: TA0002 (Execution – log events), TA0007 (Discovery signals)
- 18 Advanced Threat Modeling: cross-maps threats to techniques
- 19 Adversary Simulation: Tactics planning and constraints (no execution)
- 20 Detection Engineering: TA0006 (Credential Access – brute-force detection signals)

Note: Coverage is educational and conceptual; do not perform real offensive actions.
