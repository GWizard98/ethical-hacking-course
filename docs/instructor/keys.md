# Instructor Keys (Selected)

Use responsibly. These are conceptual keys to guide grading.

## 02 — Networking Essentials (Sample)
- Subnet/CIDR: 255.255.255.0 = /24; example 192.168.1.0/24.
- TCP handshake: SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK; establishes state.
- 301 vs 302: Permanent vs temporary redirect; SEO/cache implications.

## 06 — Web Security Fundamentals (Sample)
- XSS: Untrusted input executed in browser; defenses: output encoding, CSP, input validation.
- Cookie vs JWT: Cookie-bound server session vs self-contained token; tradeoffs (revocation, storage, CSRF).
- CSRF: Cross-site request; defenses: anti-CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, double-submit pattern.

## 09 — Vulnerability Assessment (Sample)
- CVE vs CWE: Specific vulnerability ID vs generalized weakness category.
- Good finding: Title, severity, affected scope, steps, evidence, impact, remediation, references.
- Repro steps: Ensures verification, repeatability, and remediation validation.
