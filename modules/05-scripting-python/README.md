# 05 — Scripting for Security (Python/Bash)

Objectives
- Automate small, safe tasks related to analysis and reporting

Exercises
- Bash: parse a sample log file to count unique IPs and top 5 entries.
- Python: request a safe HTTP endpoint; save status code and headers to a file.
- CLI ergonomics: add `--input` and `--output` flags with helpful `--help` text.

Deliverables
- One small script that processes local files or HTTP responses from approved targets
