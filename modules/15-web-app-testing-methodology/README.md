# 15 — Web App Testing Methodology (Safe)

Objectives
- Apply a structured, safe methodology to assess a local demo app.

Timebox: 90–180 min

Exercises
- Plan: scope, rules, safe local target (e.g., Juice Shop), and checks to perform.
- Map: crawl key routes manually; diagram flows.
- Test (conceptual): for each area (auth, session, input), note techniques you would use; do not run automated scanners.
- Report: write a findings outline with evidence placeholders and mitigations.

Deliverables
- Methodology checklist and a sample findings outline.

Resources
- OWASP WSTG: https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/

Checklist
- [ ] Scope and plan documented
- [ ] Routes/flows diagrammed
- [ ] Techniques listed per area
- [ ] Findings outline drafted

Quiz (3)
1) Why plan before testing?
2) Difference between discovery and verification?
3) One risk of automated scanning?

Rubric
- Emerging: scattered notes
- Proficient: structured plan and coverage
- Strong: clear traceability from plan → evidence → mitigation
