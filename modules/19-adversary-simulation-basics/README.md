# 19 — Adversary Simulation Basics (Safe, Conceptual)

Objectives
- Understand goals, scope, and safety controls of adversary simulation.

Timebox: 120–180 min

Exercises
- Define ROE and controls for a hypothetical internal simulation (paper-only).
- Map MITRE ATT&CK techniques to 2–3 planned TTPs (no execution).
- Draft detection and response expectations with stakeholders.

Deliverables
- Simulation plan (scope, controls, TTP mapping, detection expectations).

Resources
- MITRE ATT&CK: https://attack.mitre.org/

Checklist
- [ ] ROE and safety controls defined
- [ ] TTPs mapped to ATT&CK
- [ ] Detection expectations drafted

Quiz (3)
1) Why explicit scope is critical in simulations?
2) What is a TTP?
3) Example of a safety control?

Rubric
- Emerging: vague plan
- Proficient: clear mapping and controls
- Strong: realistic detection expectations
