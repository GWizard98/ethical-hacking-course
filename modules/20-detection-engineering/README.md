# 20 — Detection Engineering (Intro)

Objectives
- Design basic detections and validate them safely.

Timebox: 120–180 min

Exercises
- Define a simple detection (e.g., multiple failed logins) and its logic.
- Create a sample log dataset (use docs/datasets/sample-syslog.log as a starting point) and test the logic.
- Document response playbook steps.

Deliverables
- Detection logic (pseudo/Sigma-like), test results, and mini playbook.

Resources
- Sigma HQ: https://sigmahq.io/

Checklist
- [ ] Detection logic defined
- [ ] Tested on sample data
- [ ] Playbook drafted

Quiz (3)
1) What is a detection rule vs alert?
2) Why test on benign/edge cases?
3) One metric to tune false positives?

Rubric
- Emerging: unclear logic
- Proficient: testable, documented detection
- Strong: measurable, actionable playbook
