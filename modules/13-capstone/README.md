# 13 — Capstone: Assess, Harden, Document

Objectives
- Integrate skills: plan, assess an authorized local target, and report.

Timebox: 3–6 hours (can be split across days)

Exercises
- Planning: define scope, assumptions, and safety. Pick one local lab target (e.g., Juice Shop on localhost).
- Discovery: enumerate services/features safely; note findings.
- Prioritization: pick 2–3 issues to analyze deeper (conceptual is fine).
- Hardening: propose concrete mitigations for each issue.
- Reporting: compile a short report with steps, evidence, and recommendations.

Deliverables
- Capstone report (planning, discovery, prioritized issues, mitigations, appendix with notes/screenshots)

Rubric (concise)
- Emerging: partial scope, scattered notes, unclear evidence.
- Proficient: clear scope, reproducible steps, actionable mitigations.
- Strong: thoughtful risk discussion, clean structure, clear visuals.
