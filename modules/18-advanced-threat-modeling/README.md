# 18 — Advanced Threat Modeling and Attack Trees

Objectives
- Build deeper models using attack trees and misuse cases.

Timebox: 120–180 min

Exercises
- Select a system (e.g., local demo app) and define high-value assets.
- Build an attack tree for one critical goal; identify AND/OR branches.
- Prioritize mitigations based on feasibility and impact.

Deliverables
- Attack tree diagram and prioritized mitigation plan.

Resources
- Attack Trees (Schneier): https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/1999/12/attack_trees.html

Checklist
- [ ] Assets identified
- [ ] Attack tree constructed
- [ ] Mitigations prioritized

Quiz (3)
1) Difference between STRIDE and attack trees?
2) When to use AND vs OR branches?
3) One pitfall in over-modeling?

Rubric
- Emerging: shallow tree
- Proficient: clear structure and rationale
- Strong: actionable, prioritized outcomes
